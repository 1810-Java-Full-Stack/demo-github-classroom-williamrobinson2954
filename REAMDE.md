# Demo

This is just a demo of how Github Classroom works and how you can interact with it to complete my challenges

1. You should work on a different branch (one that is not master)
2. Once you have completed the assignment you may open a PR (pull request) and mention me asking for grading (my username is @Quinn-Donnelly)
3. I will post on the PR approving or requesting changes
4. If approved merge into master (you will then receive grade)
